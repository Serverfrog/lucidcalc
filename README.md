# lucidcalc

This is a decoupled Fork of https://github.com/gg-net/lucidcalc, as it is not possible to change the default PR destination in Github (which always was the gg-net/lucidcalc repostiory, compared to this one)

A simple wrapper to get raw data (lists and fields) into an calc document (xls, later xlsx or odt)
